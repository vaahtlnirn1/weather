To run the project:

1. 'npm i' to terminal
2. 'npm run dev' to terminal



The issues are that it is not wholly responsive because there are two sample phone models which I could not get the elements to be fixed. CSS is not my strongest area when it comes to building an application from scratch, but I know that is one area which I seek to improve. The app, however, is responsive and works for the majority of screens. As well, if I had the time to figure it out, I would
change the background color for when the season changes (through detecting certain temperatures or certain months or such).

There is a line graph made with Highcharts library and the point follows and gives the needed information, such as hour of the day in a little tooltip-style prompt that follows along the line graph.
Changing temperature units is also possible via a button.
